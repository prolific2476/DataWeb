# DataWeb
This is my first website built solely using HTML5
I am a retail business manager with extensive experience in using business data to make decisions. In my operational responsibilities, I am always confronted with data, more data and how to make sense out of data. Data wrangling and prepreparation are soem of the most challenging tasts when your main responsibility is people management and asset protection. An interactive website that records transactional data would be great help in this type of business management.
